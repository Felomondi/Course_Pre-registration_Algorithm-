# Course_Pre-registration_Algorithm-

This is a simple Algorithm that asigns students their desired courses durig pre-registration after they submit their requests. 
Normally, students submit upto a total of 7 or 8 requests for the classes they want for the following semester 
This algorithm is meant to asign the students their desired classes in order of priority. 
Student are asssigned classes by a particular order.
There are a couple of things that are considered when assigning classes: 
     Description of the algorithm from the Registrar's website:
         * 
         * Entry into a section is determined by the combination of your class year, the priority you give each section, and your 
             draw number.
         * Seniors’ requests are processed first followed sequentially by juniors’, sophomores’, and first-years requests.
         * Your requests are considered in the order that you list them on the registration screen, with the first item having the 
             highest priority. If one of your requests cannot be filled, then the next item in your list will be considered instead.
         * For your class year, your draw number determines when one of your requests is considered. Your top request is considered 
            immediately after the top requests of all of the students in your class with lower draw numbers. As mentioned above, if 
             your top request cannot be granted you will be enrolled in the first request on your list that can be.
         *
         * In a second pass through the requests from your class, your top request among your remaining requests will be considered 
           immediately before all of the students in your class with lower draw numbers. That is, the draw numbers work in reverse 
          compared to the first pass. The remaining passes through the requests from your class continue the pattern of the first two 
           passes, switching direction through the draw numbers on each pass.
         * You may list multiple sections of the same course among your requests but you will be enrolled only in the first one on 
            your list that is available. You will not be enrolled in multiple sections of the same course.
         * You may also list sections of different courses that meet at the same time but you will be enrolled only in the first one 
           on your list that is available. You will not be enrolled in sections with time conflicts.
         *
